# KSP-Search-Tag-Scraper
Small Tool to scarpe search tags from Kerbal Space Program


Be sure to change the kerbalDirectory and outputDirectory variables to the paths of your choice. 

The tool will spit out a KSPTags.txt file for you. The tags are not sorted alphabetically, but they are sorted by category automatically.
